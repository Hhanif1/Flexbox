<h3> Annabelle</h3>
<p> An eighteen-year-old orphan. Born and raised in Framlingham, a small town in Suffolk. Orphaned at the age of eight when her parents are publicly executed for witchcraft. Annabelle, although raised without any specific religion turns towards Luciferianism due to her parent's interest in the religion. They raised her with their own morals rather than what was acceptable by society's standards, they taught her how to read mostly Latin which lead her to learn further and also to write in Latin but, her English writing isn't as good. They also taught Annabelle the basics to spells, what is needed, how to call up demons, using protective names of the demons over simply calling them up which carried an even greater risk. After the death of her parents, Annabelle's aunt, Harriet, who also runs the town's orphanage, raises Annabelle herself until her death just a few weeks later. Using her spells and rituals for her own personal gains but her sly, quiet and isolated personality makes her the last person you'd suspect. 

She isn't the strongest girl, both emotionally and physically. Often perceived as shy, insecure and 'too sensitive,' but this all vanishes when she's with someone whose company she enjoys. The only person whom she's like this with is Henry. A childhood friend who she grew up with in the orphanage. Despite her height, she is not one to be confused with confidence. Stood at five foot seven she is the same height as many other men who are either frightened by her or even see her as a threat. Her jet black hair is long, straight and well looked after. Her eyes were incredibly bright blue and had a white sparkle about them. Her porcelain skin wasn't as smooth as someone may expect. She had a small stub like nose and slightly torn lips. There was a scar running from the corner of her lip half way across her left cheek. Her breasts were almost non-existent. They were minuscule at best. The rest of her body was thin, petite. Her body was split perfectly but her body had the appearance of seeming very long.  Having discovered her abilities to read, write and perform witchcraft at a very young age, it gave her enough time to master the techniques and little tricks to make certain spells and rituals successful.

<h3>Henry</h3>
<p>Twenty-five years old, a deserter of the Church, Henry has found himself on the run from authority. Being childhood friends with Annabelle as they grew up in the same orphanage, also very close with her aunt, Harriet. What ever happened to Henry's parents is still unknown, he was left at the foot of the orphanage when he was presumably only a few months old. Whether his parents are dead, alive or simply missing is not something that concerns him. He considers Harriet to be his mother. He was fifteen when he met Annabelle, he knew then she was different to the other children. Henry is an incredibly helpful and caring person, he never failed to help anyone out. Even if it was someone he disliked or someone from outside the orphanage. His good nature was incredibly susceptible to be taken advantage of, many people had done in the past. 

He left the orphanage at fifteen with his best friend Edward. They enlisted in the army when the war with France had broken out, a priest had come to the town recruiting specifically young men to join. He fought with Edward for ten years before returning to Suffolk. Henry is rather reliant on others when confronted with things he's unfamiliar with he would look to someone else for assistance rather than working things out for himself. Maybe that's why he's such close friends with Edward. 

His strong presence not only came from his personality but also his large body. He was a league taller than most other men, standing tall at six foot three, his long light brown hair was long enough to reach his neck and cover it, he usually kept it combed back, its thickness kept it from falling forward down his face if he were to look down at all. His body wasn't too slender and he had incredibly defined muscles, his chest and legs were probably his best features, their insane definition was a sight to be seen. he also had a small, thick beard, the hair curled under his chin and jawbone incredibly neatly. His eyes were a light mud brown however they were not very noticeable as his beard and body drew attention away from everything else.</p>
